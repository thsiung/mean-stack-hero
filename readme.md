# MEAN stack hero
### TEST1

This repo contains the source code for our course: [
The complete JavaScript developer: MEAN stack zero-to-hero](http://www.fullstacktraining.com/courses/learn-the-mean-stack)

## About the course

In this course you will learn all of the different aspects of full stack JavaScript development using the MEAN stack. We're not talking about any generators or MEAN frameworks here, we're talking about a full understanding of MongoDB, Express, AngularJS and Node.js. Throughout this course we'll show you how to use each of these technologies, and how to use them together.

The overall aim of the course is to enable to you confidently build all different types of application using the MEAN stack.

To do this, the course is divided into sections, each section focusing on a different goal. The first five sections work together building a full application, with an overall outcome of showing how to **architect and build complete MEAN applications**.

## The sections

This repo has one branch per section of the course. Each branch contains the code as it is at the *end* of the section.
